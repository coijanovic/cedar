This is part of a series of fun little programs I write to learn rust:

- [Alder](https://github.com/coijanovic/alder): A minimal implementation of Conway's Game of Life
- [Balsa](https://github.com/coijanovic/balsa): Image to Emoji
- [Cedar](https://github.com/coijanovic/cedar): Auto snake game

# Cedar

Have you ever wanted to watch your computer play snake in a somewhat clumsy fashion?
Here you go!

`cargo run` and enjoy! üêç
